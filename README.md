## Brief explanation

I used Next.js to help me with the routes, caching and the call to the given endpoint. Also, regarding CSS styles, I chose Tailwindcss (<https://tailwindcss.com/>) because I have the freedom to create my components as needed to achieve my goals.

You will see that there is a folder called components. That's where I put all the components used in several different locations. If a component is only used in one place, I prefer to store it closer to the place where it is used.
The project is organized to grow as needed.
